So we're gonna build a video game here that's going to be a 2D platformer, just a very simple proof of concept, an MVP if you will, that takes a pixelated character and uses various different enemies to combat her. She has five different lives, five hearts. She's trying to get to the end of the stage. She can collect donuts to power up and at the end of the stage, the prize is a unicorn. She has some bad guys who are shooting orange balls or orange pumpkins at her to prevent her from getting to the final goal. But this is my initial video game concept. It'll be running in the browser and I want to be able to use my arrow keys as well as the space bar to be able to jump. And maybe I'll use the tab key to shoot. If we can get that far, that's an optional feature. But yeah, let's brainstorm about this and see how far we can get in about 30 minutes.
